# Programming-Skills-Challenge-Change-up

The repository for 9181N's Change Up code

Our code is seperated into multiple .cpp files in order to make it more organized and easier to read.
Our 66 point programming skills is located in the autonomous.cpp file, however the functions used in it are defined in drive.cpp, rollers.cpp, and pid.cpp respectively. in order to have multiple .cpp files we have used header files that are included inside of our autonomous.cpp file.
